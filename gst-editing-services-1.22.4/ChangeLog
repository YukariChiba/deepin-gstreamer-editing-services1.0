	* docs/meson.build:
	  docs: explicitly declare gir build dependencies
	  As the path to the gir file is passed to hotdoc.generate_doc() and
	  not the build target itself, meson doesn't know about the dependency.
	  In turn, as the CI doesn't build everything before building the
	  documentation target, some gir files might not exist, for instance
	  in the case of gst-rtsp-server, causing the output documentation to
	  be empty.
	  The error occurred silently because hotdoc accepts wildcards for
	  *-sources arguments, thus it won't warn about a missing gir file as
	  it is legitimate for glob matching to resolve to nothing.

	  Starting with Meson 0.62, meson automatically populates the variables
	  list in the pkgconfig file if you reference builtin directories in the

	  We need this, because ${prefix}/libexec is a hard-coded value which is

	  Instead of trying to hardcode site-packages paths for different platforms
	  just use python.get_install_dir() from meson and let it deal with the rest.
	  Also no longer try to import pygobject, which would otherwise not be
	  required at build time.
	  python.get_install_dir() was at the beginning broken on Windows, but
	  that was fixed in 0.60 via https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/pull/9156
	  and since ges now requires >0.60 this can be ignored.
	  This change was motivated by the install path being wrong under MSYS2, where
	  the unix install layout is used and the detection code not taking that into
	  account.
	  This MR is a continuation of https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-editing-services/-/merge_requests/230

	* meson.build:
	  Use gmodule-no-export-2.0
	  We don't need `-Wl,--export-dynamic`, that's used only for executables
	  that needs to export an API to be used by plugins they load.

	* meson.build:
	  Remove glib and gobject dependencies everywhere
	  They are part of gst_dep already and we have to make sure to always have
	  gst_dep. The order in dependencies matters, because it is also the order
	  in which Meson will set -I args. We want gstreamer's config.h to take
	  precedence over glib's private config.h when it's a subproject.
	  While at it, remove useless fallback args for gmodule/gio dependencies,
	  only gstreamer core needs it.
